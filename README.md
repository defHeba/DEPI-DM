## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a digital marketing campaign for a custom printing company that offers a wide range of personalized products including mugs, t shirts, hoodies, tote bags, baby clothes, and custom home decor items. While the company has a strong brand identity and high product potential, its current digital content and marketing efforts are not effectively driving engagement or online sales.

The project aims to evaluate the company’s existing digital presence, identify gaps in content and strategy, and design a structured marketing campaign that improves brand awareness, strengthens customer engagement, and increases online sales. The final project will be presented as a complete digital marketing strategy supported by research, content planning, and performance metrics.
