## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a sales driven digital marketing campaign for **Dress Nada**, an online fashion brand specializing in affordable handmade event dresses for weddings, proms, and special occasions. The brand has strong organic reach on Instagram and a growing audience, but currently lacks a clear brand identity and structured marketing strategy.

Although the dresses are high quality and made by hand, the brand’s content relies mainly on customer photos and does not fully communicate its value, uniqueness, or potential. This project aims to build a clear brand identity and improve content direction in order to convert engagement into higher online sales. The final outcome will be a complete digital marketing campaign focused on increasing sales while maintaining the brand’s organic growth.
